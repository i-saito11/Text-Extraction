# Rationale for Text Extraction Analysis

In this document, I provide a rationale for the analysis performed on 10 open-access articles using Grobid and other text analysis tools. The analysis consists of the following components:

## Keyword Cloud Generation

I generated keyword clouds based on the words found in the abstract of each paper. Keyword clouds are visual representations of word frequency, where the size of each word indicates its frequency of occurrence.
By creating keyword clouds, I aimed to identify the most common and relevant terms across the abstracts of the selected articles.

## Visualization of Figure Counts

I created visualizations showing the number of figures per article.
These visualizations provide insights into the distribution of figures across the articles and help identify articles with more visual content. By visualizing figure counts, I aimed to understand the visual complexity and richness of the articles.

## Extraction of Links

I extracted and compiled a list of links found in each paper.
These links include URLs mentioned in the text content as well as those embedded within the document structure. By extracting links, I aimed to identify external references and additional resources mentioned in the articles.

### Validation Approach

To validate the accuracy of the keyword clouds, I manually reviewed the abstracts of the articles and cross-referenced the identified keywords with the actual content.
For the visualization of figure counts, I compared the generated visualizations with the actual number of figures reported in the articles.
Similarly, for link extraction, I verified the extracted links by inspecting the text content and document structure of the articles.
