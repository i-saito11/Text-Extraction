<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Traffic jams are one of the major transportation problems. The United States spends USD billions to mitigate the problem, and not always with good outcomes. This problem increases and has effects on sustainable transport, such as life quality, pollution, perishables, and costs. Large cities reduce traffic jams through congestion charges. This paper aims to reduce urban traffic congestion by estimating the charge through a multivariable model. It studies the main jammed areas in Santiago, Chile. The data came from published surveys. The model evaluation included Fisher multiple regression (F) and the determination coefficient (R 2 ). These validations showed that the model is statistically significant. They also showed that the parameter estimation was good. Finally, this model contributes to improving the Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 3, SDG 11, and SDG 13, which may be successfully applied to Santiago City, as well as to any city worldwide.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>At the present time, one of the major worldwide problems is traffic jams. There are approximately 100 million vehicles on the globe's roads today. That number is going to increase by more than 2 billion vehicles by 2050. People will see greater congestion than ever before <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. More than 50% of the worldwide population lives in urban zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Two-thirds of people will live in cities by 2030 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. These urbanization tendencies generate challenges in regard to infrastructure. Megacities faced with this foreseen influx require urgent transport planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>. Traffic congestion's overall cost in Germany, the US, and the UK in 2021 was about USD 510 billion per driver <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Easing measures include highways and downtown streets being changed into parking lots and zones declared for carpooling only. Although these measures worked for years, people do not use them as much as expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. Recent research shows that building new freeways or roads does not solve the issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. For example, In the USA, San Francisco highways have grown by 80% since 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. The Los Angeles region has been number one for six years consecutively in regard to having the worst traffic jams worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Economic growth, population rise, and urbanization increase are the root causes of traffic jams in most cities around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Both emerging and developed countries have cities with high traffic congestion. On average, emerging countries have more traffic jams than developed countries do. This could be the result of the better public transport systems in developed countries, or perhaps because urbanization is greater and continuous in emerging countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>. As emerging countries are growing fast, there are major impacts in peoples' lives. For example, Beijing drivers spend about 5 h commuting. It is a high waste of time and resources and leads to a lower quality of life. Santiago, Chile, is not an exception, as it ranks number 26 of the worst cities in managing congestion around the world. The congestion level is 39% of extra travel time, which means a delay of around 49 min per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Developed cities, as later reviewed in the literature section, such as London and Stockholm, obtained a 20% traffic-jam reduction by applying congestion charges <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. Transportation planning has three decision-making levels: strategic, tactical, and operational decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. Strategic decisions are long-term decisions concerned with transportation infrastructures, roads network, and public transit, e.g., building new streets, designing new bus routes, and widening existing routes. Tactical decisions relate to resources' effective application upon transportation's existing infrastructure, for example, distributing exclusive road space for public buses or deciding transit direction. Operational decisions are short-term decisions, e.g., demand management, public transport schedules, traffic signal timing, traffic control. This paper focuses on a combination of strategic and operational decisions. The charging price calculation uses a multivariable model. It requires the installation of toll infrastructure. Price refers to strategic decision. Time and traffic control concern operational decisions.</p><p>The literature search we conducted showed a lack of math models to figure out congestion charges. Therefore, this research aimed to reduce urban traffic congestion through a multivariable model, which allowed us to find a charging price applicable to any city worldwide. The model feeding was through surveys to residents who live in different sectors of Santiago, Chile. This paper also illustrates the main aspects of multivariablemodel development.</p><p>The paper begins with a review of the literature that is focused on global charging price experiences. Second, the methodology section illustrates the steps to develop the multivariable model. The paper then reviews the mathematical model and hypothesis testing results. Finally, the research concludes with the model feasibility analysis. This research's purpose was to find a multivariable model to reduce urban traffic congestion, which may help governments make traffic-jam decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>Governments have encouraged more sustainable transport options and discouraged unsustainable choices by adopting regulations and developing sustainable transport strategies to contribute with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 3 (good health and well-being), preventing citizens from becoming stressed in traffic jams; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), reducing the number of accidents and time wasted in commuting; and SDG 13 (climate action), generating a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as approved in 2015 by the UN, by 2030 <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Hysing et al. compared congestion-charge-implementation experiences in the Swedish cities Gothenburg and Stockholm, explaining differences in public and political acceptance. The outcomes reveal the importance of marketing and communication goals' consistency. The results also show the relevance of contextual circumstances, including the level of congestion and the public transport function <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. Dieplinger analyzed five European cities through empirical research and concluded that, in general, the congestion-charge acceptance is low. They found that, to increase citizens' acceptability, good communication is a measure that has an impact on people's welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. Glavic et al. aimed to financially and sustainably reduce traffic congestion. They decided the toll charge based on the driver's willingness to pay. User analyses of willingness to pay included day of week, trip purpose, vehicle origin, frequency of road usage, and users' monthly income. For example, a high percentage of users would not pay road tolls on weekends, and drivers who travel very often are by far less willing to pay higher toll prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Pronello and Rappazzo analyzed people's reactions to the supposed introduction of toll charges in the City of Lyon, France. The study concluded that citizens are willing to accept road tolls and that the policy must include compensations, such as improvements to alternative mobility modes and transparently informing how authorities invest revenues <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. Lindsey looked at congestion-charge investments in technology and long-term demands that may alter the traffic congestion evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. The US Census Bureau studied a new tolling approach wherein users' toll charges depend on paths, destinations, or origins. These approaches give more flexibility than conventional pricing and have shown that they may decrease traffic congestion, decrease the financial burden on drivers, and save time on the trip <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. Sandholm supports this, highlighting that decentralized and simple price schemes guarantee productive traffic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. Francke and Kaniok argued that the congestion charges are a useful tool, but it would be more efficient if prices were differentiated. The outcomes illustrate that complications arise when estimating the charges for toll pricing schemes differentiated according to both time and place <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Iseki and Demisch found that there are two factors that define the most adopted type of tolling technologies: first, the geographical zone of the road network, and second, the high complexity in estimating the charging toll price. The unification of these two factors may vary considerably with dynamic charges that vary by time of day, vehicle class, and congestion level. These authors conclude that the implementation of the congestion charge must be economically and politically integrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. Agyapong and Kolawole tried to evaluate the administration of traffic congestion in Accra, Ghana's capital. The research showed traffic congestion's major causes were poor road designs; traffic accidents; narrow roads; and traders, drivers, and pedestrians' negative attitudes. In addition, traffic jams' effects include productivity and sales declining, increased stress, pollution, and much time-consuming to get to destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. Brent and Gross saw two major factors when deciding the demand for roads with tolls' dynamic prices. One is the importance of treating high-occupancy toll roads with dynamic charges, and the other is continuous monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Gibson and Carnovale researched drivers' behavioral responses and the effects of air pollution due to the implementation of road pricing through a natural experiment in the City of Milan (Italy). They found that congestion charges depend on the availability of public transportation and suggested that public transportation may substitute congestion charges <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Cavallaro et al. examined nine UK cities and eleven international cities in the US and Europe. They concluded that a congestion charging policy reduces carbon by more than 10% <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. Coria and Zhang argued that, despite the fact that congestion charges reduce traffic jams and air pollution, air quality also depends on the dispersion of pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. Agarwal and Koo analyzed, in Singapore, the toll-rate-adjustment effect on passengers changing to public transport. When morning congestion tax incremented USD 1, commuters switched to public transportation between 12% and 20%; however, when the evening congestion tax incremented from USD 0.50 to USD 1.00, the switch to public transport was by 10% <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. Buyukeren and Hiramatsu studied how urban growth and congestion tolls should be developed, particularly in cities with public transport and private cars traveling from the suburbs into downtown. At best, decreasing traffic congestion may cause an increase in urbanism, depending on the level of substitutability between public and car transit <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Percoco analyzed the experiences of different cities worldwide and found that Milan's congestion charge measures resulted in reductions not only in congestion but also in pollution. Percoco also concluded that housing prices decline in the congestion charge zones <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. Duque-Escoba described how Colombia implemented the toll system twentyfive years ago, mainly to finance highway projects. There are now considerably lower traffic jams. However, users claim an oversaturated system and an ineffective income management. The toll price in Colombia has low dispersion depending on the vehicle type <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>. Anas and Timilsina examined the welfare impacts of the tolls system on fuel tax, excess delays, and improving fuel economy to reduce traffic congestion and atmospheric emissions in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p><p>Pricing instruments such as fuel tax and tolls on excess delays would certainly decrease emissions and congestion; however, they increase the cost of travel and, therefore, are politically difficult to execute. However, they found that applying just small tolls is socially more acceptable and has great benefits in decreasing emissions and congestion. The toll estimated for Sao Paulo is approximately BRL 10 per trip, which is socially possible. Nonetheless, the cost of a trip increases by 6.5 times. This induces drivers to consider public transport or other non-motorized modes. Emissions are reduced dramatically due to decreases in fuel use. An example is a reduction of 0.13%, on average, for every 1% increase in the monetary cost per km (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The tolls' revenues focus on improving transit control rather than building roads. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Sustainability 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 21 public transport or other non-motorized modes.

In the three cities, at the beginning of the congestion charge's implementation, citizens disagreed with the measures. However, over time, most citizens favor them. In addition, in all cases, there were improvements in public transportation due to charge revenue <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Santiago has two tolled highways. One is a city ring road, and the other unites the city's east and west. Both have rates at peak and off-peak hours, about USD 2 and USD 1, respectively. These rates discourage motorists from using tolled highways. So, city center streets get very busy as they take north-south and east-west and vice versa traffic. The pricing to be proposed needs to regulate these two things: one is the flow from tolled highways to the city streets, and the other is the vehicles circulating inside the ring road. This study's novelty is its proposal of a pricing system based on survey information and a linear regression model. Segmenting the model is through motorists entering the payment zone. The price motorists are willing to pay differs according to their areas of origin, with the highest being the eastern area, which has the highest economic income. The lowest price was from the southern area, which has the lowest economic income.

This measure rapidly improved bus services and goods' distribution and made shorter travel times for car drivers. This key measure reduced traffic by 20% in 2006, which implied 30% less extra trip time. In the restricted zone, the traffic volume is now lowering to almost 25% less than ten years ago, enabling Central London roads to focus on pedestrians and cyclists. The charge area is 21 square kilometers in London. The system is remarkably simple: when vehicles enter the area on weekdays between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., they pay a daily rate. In 2003, the charge was GBP 5, and since 2018, it has been GBP 11.50. Residents have a discount of 90%.

However, while the number of private vehicles is decreasing, the number of for-hire private vehicles is increasing, e.g., Ubers and minicabs. In 2015, this number rose by roughly 10% due to people leaving their cars at home. Minicabs and taxis do not have to pay the congestion charge. A consequence of this is that their numbers rose from 50,000 in 2013 to about 90,000 in 2017. Therefore, these increasing numbers had a negative effect on the income from the congestion price <ref type="bibr">[63]</ref>. This also decreased the traffic-flow speed across the city, affecting the public bus system. Likewise, passengers who initially used the service reverted to using private cars. Despite these setbacks, London's congestion charge is a successful strategy. It supplies efficient and sustainable options for drivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Stockholm</head><p>Stockholm had a great deal of road congestion in the past. In 2006, the authorities, apart from investing in roads or improving public transport, started to charge vehicles EUR 2 as a trial in the city center. This was a low fee, compared with car running cost and parking charges. However, this small charge reduced traffic jams by 20%. Eliasson stated that reducing 20% of traffic jams does not mean that there is 80% congestion, because traffic "congestion is a nonlinear phenomenon". Once the road capacity reaches a certain limit, the traffic begins to rise quickly. Fortunately, it also functions the other way. If congestion decreases, then traffic will reduce much faster than expected. Intriguingly, the city abolished the congestion charge in 2007. The immediate effect was that vehicles returned to the center and congestion increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Hysing et al. conducted surveys regarding the population's support for congestion charges. At the beginning, 70% disagreed. When the congestion charge disappeared, 70% of the surveys wanted the congestion charge back. Therefore, Stockholm returned the measure of congestion charges, and the traffic jams went down again by 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. Currently, Stockholm's charge zone covers 35 km 2 . Prices differ depending on the time-period of the day. The highest daily charge is about GBP 9.20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[64]</ref>.</p></div>

It is a system that charges for cars' circulation in the Milan area. The pricing system's aims are to face the increase in air pollution and decongest the city streets. Milan's created system consists of charging cars according to their emissions of fine particles (PM10). In regard to polluting particles' emission, vehicles fall into five categories. Those lower polluters, the first two categories, do not have to pay to enter the ECOPASS zone. The remainder of vehicles pay between EUR 2 and 10 to transit through the area. Motorcycles and other exceptional cases can travel for free, e.g., cars for the disabled, emergency vehicles, and public transport. The system operates with tolls and cameras that work during the hours with most traffic. The Milan ECOPASS was chosen as one of the "25 best urban practices" at the Urban World Forum, Rio de Janeiro, 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[65]</ref>.</p></div>

Cross-section data use one or more variables at the same point in time, such as surveys. The survey was used as a means of data collection, as we conducted a survey of a certain number of people from different sectors of Santiago. The questions are the following: (1) What price are you willing to pay to get into the center of Santiago between CLP 200 and 1000? (2) Where do you live? (3) Would you prefer not to pay and use public transport? With these data, we had the source to develop the multivariable model.</p><p>The estimated population variable is the "price to pay", assuming that this variable follows a normal distribution, mean and unknown variance. Student's t-test distribution was used for its estimation according to the following Formula (1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[69]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">n = σ 2 t 2 1-α,n-2 ε 2 (1)</formula><p>where the variable is n, pre-sample, and the parameters are σ 2 , variance; t 2 , T-distributions; ε, maximum estimation error; m, sample; and α, level of significance, error associated with the making decision.</p><p>The sample is used to calculate the sample variance, and this is then used as the population variance in Formula (1).</p></div>

In questionnaire-type surveys, the issue of nonresponse may be serious; the examination based on such a limited response may not truly reflect the expected response. In this case, data collection reached 635 observations, and this is rather low for the universe; however, as the research is nonexperimental, the multivariable model runs with this number of observations. The model assessment is through the F and R 2 tests to see their significance. The people surveyed were vehicle users who entered Santiago Center. Out of total 635 responses, 135 (21%) responded that they prefer to leave the car, not pay tolls, and use public transport. This percentage coincides with previous research in different countries about the effect of applying a toll in a city. The number of observations = 500 (635-135).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Result</head><p>Having developed the model equation, now we show how we calculate the average weight of every standardized coefficient. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref> shows the level of difficulty of arrival at the center from any zone based on the quality roads and transport access, and then the average distance in kilometers to the center in order to calculate the weight by distance in kilometers. Finally, with all of these numbers, we calculate the average weight of every zone, averaging the level of difficulty with the weight per distance, which replaces it in the equation model to calculate the price of the toll. Therefore, the price of the toll is CLP 428.59, but for the sake of simplification for the public, the final price will be CLP 430.</p><p>The regression on standardized variables. It states that the analysis can be extended to multivariable regressions. Thus, a variable is said to be standardized or in standard deviation units if it is expressed in terms of deviation from its mean and divided by its standard deviation. For our price example, the results are as follows:</p><p>As we can see from this regression, with the North, West, and East Sectors held constant, a standard deviation increase in the South Sector is equal, on average, to a -0.247 standard-deviation decrease in price. Similarly, holding the South, West, and East Sectors constant, a standard-deviation increase in the North Section, on average, leads to a 0.247 standard-deviation increase in price. This means that the East Sector has a greater impact on price than the other sectors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">7</ref>). That is to say, people from the East Sector are affected less by paying the charging price than the rest. Here, observers will see the advantage of using standardized variables, for standardization puts all variables on equal footing because all standardized variables have zero means and unit variances. However, from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref>, we applied different average weights for each sector, where the highest, in this case, is the South Sector, with 32%. From the F test, we see that this F value is significant at about the 5 percent level; the p-value is actually 0.0001. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that the four regressors have no impact on the regressand, in spite of the fact that the R 2 is only 0.230. Therefore, through the analysis of variance, we verified the validity of the model, testing the overall significance of an observed multiple regression and applying the F and R 2 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>The main finding of this research is to propose a charged area in the center of the City of Santiago to reduce vehicular congestion; this lies in establishing a rate price for the entry of vehicles in an area, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>. This type of charging is known as the cordon rate. It is interesting to see that other studies, such as the one developed by Crotte et al., indicate that the two most favorable cities to establish this type of measure are Bogotá and Santiago <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">77]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">12</ref> shows the Santiago district data. Santiago has a high population, and its density is between that of London and Milan (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). However, the vehicles number per 1000 inhabitants is much lower. This may be one of the explanatory causes for why the fixed price (USD 0.46) is much lower than those of other cities. Another reason which may explain the low surveys-based price set in contrast to European capitals is the GDP per capita, which is about a third that of these European capitals.</p><p>Chile has higher emissions than European countries. This may be due to its less developed industry, but also to an electricity generation mixed matrix. By May 2022, the installed capacity was 57.8% based on renewable sources (23.1% hydraulic, 20.8% solar, 11.9% wind, 1.9% biomass, and 0.2% geothermal), while 42.2% corresponds to thermal sources (15.8% coal, 15.7% natural gas, and 10.7% oil) <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[78]</ref>. Tehran's weekly rate is USD 11.5, which is higher than the estimated rate for Santiago, Chile, in this study. Iran's GDP is approximately half of Chile's. In all the cities shown in the table, there was a reduction in traffic congestion that, in the worst case, was 20% in Stockholm, 30% in London, and 80% in Tehran. The rate, based on the number of vehicles entering the cordon, allows the income valuation. The rate also allows us to calculate the CO 2 savings, since there is a reduction in circulation, and decreases in noise pollution. There is a reduction in road accidents, too. Authorities implementing the rate should inform the population about the funds that will benefit the restricted-area users.</p><p>Chile's kg CO 2 /USD 1000 indicator is 0.17, like Italy (0.13) and the United Kingdom (0.11). This shows that Chile is on the right track. Applying congestion prices would be a contribution in the same way.</p><p>The strength of this research is the development of a simple randomized scheme with a sample size that meets the statistical criteria for this type of study. Moreover, the price value obtained considered the value from the survey. Considering area distances and access difficulty, origin areas corrected the value. Since it started, the Santiago urban highway has three controversial subjects: first, economic questioning to a state subsidy granted to highway concessionaires; second, transportation engineering challenge regarding the effectiveness of addressing the vehicular congestion problem through highway construction; and three, urban architectural has worries about the effects that highway infrastructure may have on the neighborhoods it crosses <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[80]</ref>. In addition, the calculated charging price would be the base to make a dynamic charge, which considers the time of day and vehicle class. Therefore, these must be the other aspects that are studied in order for this proposal to be addressed in a comprehensive manner, considering all aspects of the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper developed a methodology to analyze the data collected by surveys and a multivariable model to reduce urban traffic congestion by estimating the charging price. The first evaluation of the model used empirical data from the City of London and then validated them with data from other researched cities. Then the paper described data collection through a survey and found the pay disposition to enter Santiago Center's congested areas. The paper calculated a charging price of CLP 428.59, regardless of the origin's sector. The model testing was through the multiple regression overall significance in terms of F and R 2 . These validation tests proved that the model is statistically significant. The sustainable transportation effects in reducing urban traffic congestion via the charging price are increased quality of life, less polluting emissions, reduction in deteriorated products for being stuck in traffic, and lessening extra-fuel consumption. This model contributes to improving the Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 11 and SDG 13.

One is a city ring road, and the other unites the city's east and west. Both have rates at peak and off-peak hours, about USD 2 and USD 1, respectively. These rates discourage motorists from using tolled highways. So, city center streets get very busy as they take north-south and east-west and vice versa traffic. The pricing to be proposed needs to regulate these two things: one is the flow from tolled highways to the city streets, and the other is the vehicles circulating inside the ring road. This study's novelty is its proposal of a pricing system based on survey information and a linear regression model. Segmenting the model is through motorists entering the payment zone. The price motorists are willing to pay differs according to their areas of origin, with the highest being the eastern area, which has the highest economic income. The lowest price was from the southern area, which has the lowest economic income. Another contribution of this work is the calculation of the emission of greenhouse gases that will be saved both within and outside the restriction zone, as well as the calculation of the savings in noise pollution.An increasing number of countries in the world, particularly in Europe, are using the congestion pricing approach to solve congestion and pollution. However, there are few cities that apply it directly.Table1shows the result of the Web of Science search using "congestion pricing" as a keyword and restricted to transport and the year 2022. The search gave 69 results. Some papers evaluate pricing systems, while other papers evaluate mixed options, such as vehicles' restriction days for air pollution or for degree of pollution thrown by the vehicle. Ten papers were selected for their closeness to the theme. In Europe, London, Stockholm, and Milan only apply the pricing approach, and outside Europe, so do Singapore and Tehran. Only one of the studied cases uses a linear regression model. It classifies Europe cities regarding low emission zones. It also determines if this measure is efficient with</figDesc></figure>

The pricing to be proposed needs to regulate these two things: one is the flow from tolled highways to the city streets, and the other is the vehicles circulating inside the ring road. This study's novelty is its proposal of a pricing system based on survey information and a linear regression model. Segmenting the model is through motorists entering the payment zone. The price motorists are willing to pay differs according to their areas of origin, with the highest being the eastern area, which has the highest economic income. The lowest price was from the southern area, which has the lowest economic income. Another contribution of this work is the calculation of the emission of greenhouse gases that will be saved both within and outside the restriction zone, as well as the calculation of the savings in noise pollution.An increasing number of countries in the world, particularly in Europe, are using the congestion pricing approach to solve congestion and pollution. However, there are few cities that apply it directly.Table1shows the result of the Web of Science search using "congestion pricing" as a keyword and restricted to transport and the year 2022. The search gave 69 results. Some papers evaluate pricing systems, while other papers evaluate mixed options, such as vehicles' restriction days for air pollution or for degree of pollution thrown by the vehicle. Ten papers were selected for their closeness to the theme. In Europe, London, Stockholm, and Milan only apply the pricing approach, and outside Europe, so do Singapore and Tehran. Only one of the studied cases uses a linear regression model. It classifies Europe cities regarding low emission zones. It also determines if this measure is efficient with respect to pollution. No other study uses multiple linear regression or segmentation by city zones. Only two papers report on surveys; however, their surveys are different from the one used in this paper.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,166.67,133.72,263.76,162.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The analysis of variance approach is used to test the overall significance of an observed multiple regression. It is tested through the F and R 2 tests. Table <ref type="table">8</ref> shows the ANOVA results of the exercise. We cannot utilize the typical t-test to examine the joint hypothesis that simultaneously the true coefficients of the partial slope are zero. Nevertheless, this joint hypothesis could be tested by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique, which can be demonstrated as follows: Decision Rule; given the k-variable regression model:</p><p>The F test.</p><p>To test the hypothesis H0:</p><p>H1: Not all slope coefficients are simultaneously zero.</p><p>If F &gt; f (α, k-1,n-k), reject H0; otherwise, we accept H0, where F α(k-1,n-k) is the critical F value at the α level of significance and (k -1) numerator and (nk) denominator. Otherwise, if the p-value of F is sufficiently low, reject H0. This means that the sample data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the multivariable model fits the data better than the model with no independent variables.</p><p>There is a close relationship between the F test used in the analysis of variance and the coefficient of correlation, ρ. These two factors change directly. Therefore, the F test, which is an indicator of the significance of the estimated regression, as well as a significance test of ρ. That is to say, testing the null hypothesis in the prior calculation is equal to testing the null hypothesis that ρ (the population) is zero. A ρ of 0.480 (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>) is reasonable for a study of this type.

This R 2 of 0.230 seems to be a "low" value. Is it statistically different from zero? There is a relevant relationship between F and R 2 for the specific case of four regressors.
