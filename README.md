# Text Extraction Project

This project focuses on extracting structured data from PDF files using the Grobid tool and Python scripts.

## Scripts

### keyword_cloud.py

This script generates a keyword cloud from the abstracts extracted from TEI XML files produced by Grobid.

### figures.py

This script counts the number of figures in TEI XML files generated by Grobid and visualizes the counts.

### links.py

This script extracts links from TEI XML files produced by Grobid and filters out unwanted links.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Grobid (running instance, port 8070)
- [Grobid Client Python](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid_client_python) library

## Usage

1. Install Python and Grobid.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/i-saito11/Text-Extraction.git`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Python scripts:
